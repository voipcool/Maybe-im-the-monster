# Layin' in the bed that I made all alone
Guess I'm not surprised, honestly
Praying in my head that you stayed, and I hope
You'll miss me eventually

[Pre-Chorus]
People wanna talk when I'm not around to hear
Really, they don't know what I'm made of
People keep on walking so far away from here
Clearly, I'm the one they're afraid of

[Chorus]
One after another, they've always come and gone
So what if I'm the monster that's been here all along?
They're droppin' like flies whenever I'm around
So used to goodbyes, there's comfort in the sound
Maybe I'm the monster that's been here all along

[Verse 2]
Bend until you break and you can't take any more
I'm not worth the trouble, it seems
I would say you're wrong, but I've been here before
You won't be the last one to leave

[Pre-Chorus]
People wanna talk when I'm not around to hear
Really, they don't know what I'm made of
People keep on walking so far away from here
Clearly, I'm the one they're afraid of
[Chorus]
One after another, they've always come and gone
So what if I'm the monster that's been here all along?
They're droppin' like flies whenever I'm around
So used to goodbyes, there's comfort in the sound
Maybe I'm the monster that's been here all along

[Bridge]
You're safe here, no need to run and hide
Underneath your cover now
Don't be scared, there's nothing left inside
Since you ate my heart out

[Chorus]
One after another, they've always come and gone
So what if I'm the monster that's been here all along?
They're droppin' like flies whenever I'm around
So used to goodbyes, there's comfort in the sound
Maybe I'm the monster that's been here all along

‚ÄúMonster‚Äù is a song by Gabbie Hanna off of her debut album. It was first announced on her Instagram story on the 4th of October. The music video was released on October 26th, and an alternate vertical version was released exclusively on IGTV.

She appeared on Genius' series Verified to explain the meaning behind the song.

In this video, at the second and last lines of the chorus, the audio was taken from two different microphones and the end result was particularly odd. This inspired many memes on the Internet. Read more about this here.

I believe the song is about Gabbie‚Äôs youth. Gabbie mentioned various times that she experienced neglect as a child and the song expresses how she felt.
